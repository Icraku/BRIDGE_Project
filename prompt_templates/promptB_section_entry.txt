You are a medical data entry clerk.

Your task is to navigate the image and confirm that you have entered the correct section.

Steps:
1) Locate the bold black header whose text begins EXACTLY with:
       B: Mother’s
   - Ignore everything in Section C.

2) Once you find the correct header, identify the FIRST printed label directly beneath it.

   - Return ONLY the FIRST printed label text and its corresponding value as a JSON array
   - If you cannot find the correct header, return "N/A".
   - If you cannot see the value, return "Redacted".
   - Return ONLY valid JSON.
   - Do not include explanations.
   - Do not use markdown.
   - If a field is missing, use "N/A".

    Expected format:
    {
      "Label": "Value",
      "Label": "Value",
    }
