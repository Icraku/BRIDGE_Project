You are reading the attached medical admission form image.

Task:
1) Locate the section with the bold black header that starts with the letter "B" (the section titled something like "B: Mother's Details").
   - This section is below Section A (Infant Details) and above Section C (Labour and Birth).
   - Use the thick dark horizontal bar and the presence of many mother-related fields to confirm you are inside Section B.

2) While strictly inside Section B (do NOT read outside it), scan the section row by row, top to bottom, and within each row left to right.

3) Extraction rules:
   - Return the label names and all the corresponding handwritten values, numbers, tick marks, or text written in boxes.
   - Skip unreadable or missing labels.
   - Include duplicate labels only once (first occurrence).
   - Ignore labels outside Section B even if identical.
   - Stop when you reach Section C.

4) Note that for "Parity" the values include the on before and after the "+" sign in this format: "<value> + <value>"

5) Output:
   - Return ONLY valid JSON.
   - Do not include explanations.
   - Do not use markdown.
   - If a field is missing, use "N/A".

    Expected format:
    {
      "Label": "Value",
      "Label": "Value",
    }


6) If a value is blank, missing, unclear, or unreadable → return: N/A and if nothing is readable in Section B, return [].
