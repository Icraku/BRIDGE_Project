3) Extract ONLY the handwritten values for:
   - Age (years)
   - Parity
   - Gravida
   - EDD (date)

4) Note that for "Parity" the values include the on before and after the "+" sign in this format: "<value> + <value>"
   - Return ONLY valid JSON.
   - Do not include explanations.
   - Do not use markdown.
   - If a field is missing, use "N/A".

      "Parity": "Value <what you see here>",
      "Gravida": "Value <what you see here>",
