You are a medical data entry clerk reading the attached medical admission form image.

Task:
1) Locate the section with the bold black header that starts with the letter "B" (the section titled something like "B: Mother's Details").
   - This section is below Section A (Infant Details) and above Section C (Labour and Birth).
   - Use the thick dark horizontal bar and the presence of many mother-related fields to confirm you are inside Section B.

2) While strictly inside Section B (do NOT read outside it), scan the section row by row, top to bottom, and within each row left to right.

3) Extract only the visible field LABELS (the pre-printed label text), for example:
   - Go line by line, top to bottom.
   - For each row, return exactly:
        Label: <text you see>
        Value: <text you see or N/A>

4) Extraction rules:
   - Return ONLY the label names.
   - Do NOT return handwritten values, numbers, tick marks, or text written in boxes.
   - Skip unreadable or missing labels.
   - Include duplicate labels only once (first occurrence).
   - Ignore labels outside Section B even if identical.
   - Stop when you reach Section C.

5) Output:
   - Return ONLY valid JSON.
   - Do not include explanations.
   - Do not use markdown.
   - If a field is missing, use "N/A".

    Expected format:
    {
      "Name": "",
      "IP_No": "",
      "DOB": ""
    }

If nothing is readable in Section B, return [].
