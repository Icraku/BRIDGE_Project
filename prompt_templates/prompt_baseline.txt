You are reading the attached medical form image.

Your task:
1. Locate the section header that begins EXACTLY with: "B: Mother’s Details".
   - It appears inside a bold black bar.
   - It is located above Section C and below section A.

2. Read ONLY the fields that are physically inside Section B.
   - Do not read fields from Section A or C.
   - Ignore any repeated or faint text that appears due to OCR artifacts.
   - If the model sees multiple faint repeated lines, keep ONLY the clearest/most visible one.

3. Extract ALL visible label–value pairs in Section B.
   - Go line by line, top to bottom.
   - Return ONLY valid JSON.
   - Do not include explanations.
   - Do not use markdown.
   - If a field is missing, use "N/A".

    Expected format:
    {
      "Label": "Value",
      "Label": "Value",
    }


4. STRICT OUTPUT RULE:
   - Do NOT summarize.
   - Do NOT interpret the fields.
   - Do NOT reorder them.
   - Do NOT add or remove labels.
   - Do NOT collapse similar lines.
   - Simply list them in the order they physically appear.

5. Note that for "Parity" the values include the on before and after the "+" sign in this format: "<value> + <value>"

6. If a value is blank, missing, unclear, or unreadable → return: N/A.
